**Introduction:**

In this problem, we are required to create a netlist that represents a given circuit using ngspce. To do so, we will use the following steps:

- First, we will define the nodes of the circuit.
- Then, we will define the components of the circuit.
- Finally, we will write the netlist using ngspice syntax.
**Solution:**

To represent the given circuit using ng spice, we first need to define the nodes of the network. The nodes are defined as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
    \textbf{Node} & : \quad \text{in}, \quad \text{out}. \\
\end{align*}
$$

Then, we will define the
