**Introduction:**

In this problem, we are asked to write a **SPICE netlist** that simulates a half-wave rectifier using the provided parameters:

- $V_1$ is a sine wave source with frequency $f = 60 \text{ Hz}$, amplitude $A = 10$, and period $\tau = 0.0333\text{ s}$
- $D_1$ is a diode with a forward voltage drop of $V_f = 0.7 \text{ V}$ and a reverse saturation current of $I_s = 10^{-18}\text{ A}$
- The load resistance $R_{load} = 1\text{ k
