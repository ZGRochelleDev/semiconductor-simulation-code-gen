Answer:
**Given:**

- The voltage source $V_{\text{CC}}$ is equal to $12 \mathrm{\,V}$;
- The resistance of the resistor $R_c$ is equal to $4.7 \mathrm{k\Omega}$;
- The resistance $R_e$ is equal to $R_e = 1 \mathrm{k\Omega}$. 
- The resistors $R_b1$ and $R_b2$ are connected between the voltage source $V_{CC}$ and the base terminal, respectively.

**Required:**

We need to write a **SPICE netlist** that represents the given circuit.  
**Introduction:**

In this problem, we are required to write a **SPINCE netlist** that represents a given circuit. For this, we should first understand the basic structure of a **SPINCE file**, which includes the following:

- A header section containing information about the simulation,
- An input section defining
