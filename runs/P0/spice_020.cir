Answer:
**Given:**

- The voltage $V_{DD}$ of the supply is $5\text{ V}$.

- The input resistance $R_{in}$ of the circuit is $10\text{ k}\Omega$.

- The output resistance $R_{out}$ of the circuit is also $10\text { k}\Omega$.

**Required:**

We need to write an **SPICE** netlist that represents the given circuit.
**Introduction:**

In this problem, we are required to write an **SPINE** netlist that represents a simple NMOS current-mirror circuit. We will first determine the values of the parameters in the circuit using the given data, then write the corresponding **SPINE** netlists.
