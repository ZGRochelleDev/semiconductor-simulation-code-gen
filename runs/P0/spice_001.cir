Answer:
**Required:**

We need to write an ngspice-compatible spicetext that represents a dc voltage divider with $R_1=1\ \mathrm{k\Omega}$ and $R_2=2\ \mathrm{k\ \Omega}$. Then, we need to run an operating point analysis on this circuit and print the dc voltage at node $\text{out}$.

**Introduction:**

In this problem, we are required to create an ngspice-compatible spice netlist for a dc voltage divider with given values of resistors. We will then perform an operating point analysis on the circuit and display the output voltage at node $\text{o}$.
