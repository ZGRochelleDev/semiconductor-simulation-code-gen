**Introduction:**

In this problem, we are required to write an ngspic e net list that represents a **diode clipper**. To do so, we will first define what a diode clipper is and then write its ngspice net list.

A diode clipper is a circuit used to remove unwanted or excessive voltage levels from a signal source. It consists of a diode connected between the input and output terminals of the circuit. The diode acts as a switch, allowing current to flow only when the input voltage exceeds a certain threshold. When the input voltage falls below this threshold, the diode
