b) Explain how you generated this netlist.


<span style="color:#4257B2">**What is the difference between a netlist and a schematic?**</span>
**Introduction:**

In electronics engineering, **netlists** are used to describe electronic circuits using a specific language or format. They provide a precise representation of the circuit's components, connections, and behavior. On the other hand, **schematics** offer a visual depiction of the same circuit but may not convey all the details required by engineers.

<span style="color:#C34632">**Why do we need both netlists and schematics?**</span>

Netlists are essential for detailed analysis and simulation because they contain information about every component, connection, and parameter within the circuit. This allows engineers to perform complex calculations, such as determining current flow, voltage drops, and power diss
