# In this example, the JOIN command functionality is demonstrated using 3D shapes generated by VictoryMesh

# Required Modules
#  Victory Mesh
#   -3D Meshing
#   -3D Solid Modeling

# Example Name
SET name = "VM_Solid_Model_ex04"

#### STRUCTURE SPECIFICATION ####

# Create cuboid
CUBOID from = "0,0,0" to = "1,1,1" material = "oxide" out = "cuboid"

# Create pyramid
PYRAMID angle = 120 base.center = "0.5,0.5,0" length.x = 1 length.y = 1 \
