# 2D JOIN

# In this example, the JOIN command functionality is demonstrated using 2D shapes

# Required Modules
#  VictoryMesh
#   -2D Meshing
#   -2D Solid Modeling

# Example Name
SET name = "VM_Solid_Model_ex03"

GO victorymesh simflags = "-P 4"

# Create circle
SPHERE center = "0,0" radius = "0.5" height = "0.5" \
material = "sio2" out = "circle"

ROTATE angle = 180 point.a = "0,0"

# Create cube
CUBOID from = "-0.5,0.0" to = "0.5,1.5" \
material = "silicon" out = "cube"

# Using the JOIN command, the circle and cube will be joined together
JOIN in.a = "cube" in.b = "circle" out = "join"

# Create device mesh
REMESH delaunay unified out = "join1"
REFINE max.size = 0.05

# Add constant donor (n-type)
FIELD constant regions = "silicon" name = "arsenic" \
value = "1e16"

# VictoryVisual is used to generate the plot
