# SPLIT in 3D

# In this example, a 3D pyramid is generated, split into two reusable parts

# Required Modules
#  Victory Mesh
#   -3D Meshing
#   -3D Solid Modeling

# Example Name
SET name = "VM_Solid_Model_ex07"

GO victorymesh simflags = "-P 4"

# Create pyramid
PYRAMID angle = 120 base.center = "0.5,0.5,0" length.x = 1 length.y = 1 material = "silicon" out = "pyramid"

REMESH delaunay out = "pyramid"

SAVE out = "$'name'_pyramid"


# SPLIT the shape into two along the specified axis
SPLIT axis = "X" offset = "0.3" out.a = "$'name'_l" out.b = "$'name'_r"

# load in and remesh one part
REMESH delaunay in="$'name'_l"
SAVE out = "$'name'_left"

# load in and remesh the second part
REMESH delaunay in="$'name'_r"
SAVE out = "$'name'_right"

# VictoryVisual is used to generate the plots
