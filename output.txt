Answer:
**Given:**

- $R = 1\text{ k}\Omega$
- $C = 100 \text{ nF}$
- Input voltage: $V_{in} = 1\text V$

**Required:**

We need to write an SPICE netlist that represents the given circuit.
**Introduction:**

In this problem, we are required to write an SPICE model for a low-pass filter using the following parameters:

$$\begin{aligned}
R &= 1\text{ } \mathrm{k}\Omega\\
C &= 100 \mathrm{nF}\\
V_{in} &= 1\text V\\
\end{aligned}$$
